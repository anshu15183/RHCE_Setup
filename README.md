# RHCE Exam Practice Environment Setup

## How to Run

Run the following command from the `/root` directory to execute the script directly:
```bash
cd /root && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshu15183/RHCE_Setup/refs/heads/main/a.sh | sh
```
or
```bash
cd /root && curl -s https://tiny.one/mww5eu6v | sh
```

This will set up the required environment automatically.
